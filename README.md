# 👁️ Food-Vision 🍔

## Introduction
It is an end-to-end **CNN Image Classification Model** notebook which identifies the food in your images. 

In this project I was working with pre-trained classification model **EfficientNetB0** and **Food101 Dataset**.

The Food-101 dataset consists of 101 food categories with 750 training and 250 test images per category, making a total of 101k images. The labels for the test images have been manually cleaned, while the training set contains some noise.

## How can you use it?
